# Excel Homework and Partial General Notes


Answers to excel homework, but I am also going to centralize my general notes here.

I am going to test this in a push, then continue to with a full readme in another repository
that isn't a homework storage one.

#### For git repositories,you must initialize and pull down to the initialized folder before git status, add ., commit -m "message", and push back up to the site, or else there will be a merge error.

However, there is an override command git pull --allow-unrelated-histories which will help.


### A. BASIC BASH COMMANDS 

Mainly used to help us get around without having to click.

1. cd, for change directory.
- Helps us navigate
**cd ~** is an important command, as it allows us to return to the root level directory or
folder of your operating system (OS). A root folder is defined as a folder that contains 
all other folders

2. ls, list
- This will list what is in a specific folder

3. rm, remove

4. pwd, present working directory
- Just shows you where you are in your Finder, where you are in relation to the top-level directory.

5. help

I mean, you can essentially learn all the commands as long as you can execute the help 
command and read the syntax/arguments required to use the function you're interested in using.


1. git init
I conceptualize this command as saying that a folder is now prepped to interact with



### Miscellany (Interesting and useful commands from StackOverflow results)

git remote add <name> <url>
"If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:"
git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch> master

git push --set-upstream https://github.com/richardkyu/ExcelHomework master

rm -rf .[^.] .??* (when i executed this in bash, it blasted my local directory's connection
to the online directory on GitHub.


## Notable interactions and important thoughts log*

1.29.2019 Started learning Python.

* 1.29.2019 11:58 PM To Sosa - I made the commit and posted the link before the 11:59 
deadline, but I really might have missed it if not for your reminder.
* 1.29.2019 I also insist on using the bash command line at any available opportunity 
until competence or until it feels like second-nature.

* .md stands for markdown, and it is the file-type of the present README file, people use
this formatting because it is easy to format into HTML when uploaded to sites like GitHub,
according to some sources.

* testing section link via GitHub's official help page (hover and drag)
https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#section-links


For using these commands, I'm assuming that we are in the relevant directory beforehand.
